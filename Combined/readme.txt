I am adding this file to let people know what is and is not included in the ALL patch.

Included:
argent tournament
AHBOT with VIPAccounts (had to combine the 2, because VIPAccounts require auctionhousebot.cpp)
Dalaran Sewers
Fix Turret
GM 1 NORMAL
Guildhouses (sell option not working, and it does not take gold when you buy. it does make sure you have the gold. Will be fixed...)
Isle of Conquest
Paladin redeaming the dead hack (yes it is a hack. got no complaints so far)
Ruby Sanctum
TeleNPC2
Wintergrasp
XP After Level 100


Not Included:
Icecrown Citadel by bolvor (crappy patch. doesn't work and is worthless without gunship)
AC2 (Added a patch that does include this.)
BOTS


Only reason AC2 and BOTS haven't been added... haven't had time. it is 7am now and I have been up all night fighting BOTS... didn't get no XP either....
