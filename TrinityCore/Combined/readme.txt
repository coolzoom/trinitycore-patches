All updates to these patches are done by LordPsyan. Only a couple were originally created by him.

I am adding this file to let people know what is and is not included in the ALL patch.

Included:

argent tournament
AHBOT with VIPAccounts (had to combine the 2, because VIPAccounts require auctionhousebot.cpp)
Dalaran Sewers
GM 1 NORMAL
Guildhouses (sell option not working, and it does not take gold when you buy. it does make sure you have the gold. Will be fixed...)
Paladin redeaming the dead hack (yes it is a hack. got no complaints so far)
Ruby Sanctum
TeleNPC2
Wintergrasp
XP After Level 100
rest on duel (resets your hp's mana etc, and should reset cooldown timers after duel ends)
TrinityJail


Not Included:
AC2
City Conquest
Gamble
Beastmaster
PVPRanks
