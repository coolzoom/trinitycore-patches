If you have heard of a patch that you would like added, just ask. We will test it out, and, in most cases, make it work. (Playerbots do not work, and we will not be trying to make it work). If you found some DB related additions you would like added, we can do that too! Get you custom realm up and running so you can start enjoying your own Realm of Warcraft!
