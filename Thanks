This is where I will put all the thanks I can remember. People who work their butts off on patches deserve a thank you.

For starters, I want to thank trickerer... for updating my old playerbots and making npcbots awesome. I have started working on playerbots again, but it is not yet complete.

AC2 - Thanks Belove!
City Conquest Originally from: http://www.ac-web.org/forums/showthread.php?t=89550 (no longer in repo, but a cool script. Might add later.)

Many of the other patches, like VIP Accounts, Guildhouses, Gamble... came from spgm's repository.

Bots are back and compile, but not fully working. many quest things don't work, and teleporting bots is iffy at best.

AHBot thanks to Aokromes. Much of that code is in with this one. I have posted a full ahbot with vip accounts both with and without glyphs. I am also adding VIP accounts for use without AHBOT.

TeleNPC2 Original author : Wilibald09 (as stated in the patch) Updated by me for the past 3 or 4 years. There is a similar patch by Aokromes and maintained by thedevnull but not as recent.

can't remember the rest. will post them as I find the original owners.

New Patches:

Thanks to lasyan3

1. Cheats.
2. CustomAttackSpeed
3. Fast Fishing
4. Guard-Elite-Honor
5. RespawnSpeed

More to come. Hopefully I will take some time soon to update this thanks file. Those who work hard on patches should get proper credit.
Anyone who finds an original creator of a script I have in this repo, please let me know so I can tell them thank you.
