This is where I will put all the thanks I can remember. People who work their butts off on patches deserve a thank you.

Many of the other patches, like VIP Accounts, Guildhouses, Gamble... came from spgm's repository.

Bots are officially dead until I can pull NPC Bots out, which sucks cuz those actually worked. I will attempt to make 2 separate patches, 1 for playerbots and 1 for npc bots.
NPC Bots will be difficult, and change alot of files to make it work... big time hack.

TeleNPC2 Original author : Wilibald09 (as stated in the patch) Aokrames has nothing at all to do with this patch.

can't remember the rest. will post them as I find the original owners.
