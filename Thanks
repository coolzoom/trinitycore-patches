This is where I will put all the thanks I can remember. People who work their butts off on patches deserve a thank you.

For starters, I want to thank trickerer... for updating my old playerbots and making npcbots awesome. I have started working on playerbots again, but it is not yet complete.

AC2 - Thanks Belove!

Many of the other patches, like VIP Accounts, Guildhouses, Gamble... came from spgm's repository.

Transmogrification and Reforging thanks to Rochet2.

TeleNPC2 Original author : Wilibald09 (as stated in the patch) Updated by me for the past 3 or 4 years. There is a similar patch by Aokromes.
