This is where I will put all the thanks I can remember. People who work their butts off on patches deserve a thank you.

Many of the other patches, like VIP Accounts, Guildhouses, Gamble... came from spgm's repository.

Bots I have to give thanks to many. iperpido's is where I originally got this, which came from peldor and so on. I have no idea who first wrote the script, but thanks to that person as well

TeleNPC2 Original author : Wilibald09 (as stated in the patch) Aokrames has nothing at all to do with this patch.
