TrinityCore-Patches now has a web site. There is a specific topic for patches. The url is:

http://www.realmsofwarcraft.com/bb

Instead of posting an "issue" with suggestions of questions, try using the wiki. I will have a forums in there, where I will check often to answer questions.

Now for the patches...
I will start with ALL patches. Currently there are 4 ALL Patches.

* ALL without any bots.
* ALL with New NPCBots
* ALL with Old NPCBots
* All with Playerbots and Old NPCBots

I am also accepting donations. I am only adding this because a few people have asked how to donate. I never
thought about it, and never expected to get donations. I do this because I enjoy it. If you want to donate,
I won't deny you, but I will not be upset if you don't.

to donate, go here: http://www.realmsofwarcraft.com/donate.php or make a donation through paypal... realmsofwarcraft@gmail.com

Here is a list of the patches, and a detailed description of each. (Not finished, but working on it.)

* **AHBot-No-VIP-Glyphs.patch** - 
  AuctionHouse Bot buys and sells items in the AuctionHouse. Config settings and DB settings.

* **All-In-One-NPC.patch** - 
  NPC that does a variety of things, from buffing to morphing.

* **ArenaGambler.patch** - 
* **Beastmaster.patch** - 
  NPC that offers the sale of hunter pets. My version has pets in DB, and you can turn on/off hunter only, and GM only. You can also decide how much gold or tokens per pet, instead of per pet type (normal or exotic) like all the other beastmaster patches do.

* **CongratsOnLevel.patch** - 
  Small script that gives a reward for playing the game. Currently set for 2 items, gold and a spell for each 10 levels obtained.

* **CrossFactionBG.patch** - 
* **Fake_Players.patch** - 
  Populates the "who" list with up to 49 fake online players. Message appears saying they do not want to be disturbed when whispered to.

* **Fatigue.patch** - 
  Turn on or off the fatigue timer.

* **GuildHouses.patch** - 
  NPC that offers guild leaders a guild house. Once a leader purchases the house, and member of that guild can teleport using this NPC to the guild. Non guild members will not be able to teleport.

* **GuildLevelSystem.patch** - 
* **Individual-XP-Rate.patch** - 
  Allows setting of different XP rates. I have not tested, so not sure how to set them.
* **KillStreak.patch** - 
  Rewards for pvp based on number of successful wins in a row... I think.
* **LevelNPC.patch** - 
  NPC that offers level using gold or tokens. Config option (forgot to put those in, will get right on that)
* **New_NPCBots**.patch - 
  Server controlled "players" that run in your party. Must be prespawned, and factions set (a,h,m - Alliance, Horde, Monster) NPCBots tend to be a bit over powered, but great for low population servers

* **NPCBuff.patch** - 
  NPC that casts buffs on players. Buffs and cost in DB.

* **npc-enchant.patch** - 
* **Old_NPCBots.patch** - 
  Same as New NPCBots exept that you can use commands to add them to your party, or you can spawn an NPC Giver guy that will spawn them for you.

* **Passive_Anticheat.patch** - 
  Best anti cheat out there. checks for speed hacks, flying, etc.

* **Playerbot-NPCBots.patch** - 
  Old NPCBots patch plus a playerbot patch that allows you to "log in" another character on your account, controlled by the server. Buggy at best, but fun to play with.

* **ProfessionNPC.patch** - 
  NPC that will give you +10 to any profession... for a price. Price can be token or gold, set in config file.

* **Reforging.patch** - 
* **Summon_NPC.patch** -
  This is an item, that when right-clicked, will spawn an npc (default entry number 100000). I use it to summon my TeleNPC2 NPC, so players can teleport anywhere any time. The NPC will automatically vanish after a few minutes.
 
* **TeleNPC2.patch** - 
  The best of the best teleport scripts. an NPC with well organized coordinates for teleporting. You can add catagories, and locations, and restrict those locations in many way, such as by cost, specific guild, level required, etc.

* **Transmogrification.patch** - 
* **TriniIRC.patch** - 
  Allows players to join a channel (set in config) and chat to people in an IRC channel. Configs are a bit confusing, but once working, you can admin the realm via IRC (so you can connect to IRC on your smartphone, and kick\ban players, chat, and do other commands).

Added some details, but check the website for more information on the patches.
