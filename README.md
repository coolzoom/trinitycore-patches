Decided to do a readme file. I will be editing this over time and it will have info for all patches, in Alphabetical Order...

Kinda...

I will start with ALL patches. Currently there are 4 ALL Patches.

* 1. ALL without any bots.
* 2. ALL with New NPCBots
* 3. ALL with Old NPCBots
* 4. All with Playerbots and Old NPCBots

I am also accepting donations. I am only adding this because a few people have asked how to donate. I never
thought about it, and never expected to get donations. I do this because I enjoy it. If you want to donate,
I won't deny you, but I will not be upset if you don't.

to donate, go here: http://www.realmsofwarcraft.com/donate.php or make a donation through paypal... realmsofwarcraft@gmail.com
