Decided to do a readme file. I will be editing this over time and it will have info for all patches, in Alphabetical Order...

Kinda...

I will start with ALL patches. Currently there are 4 ALL Patches.

* ALL without any bots.
* ALL with New NPCBots
* ALL with Old NPCBots
* All with Playerbots and Old NPCBots

I am also accepting donations. I am only adding this because a few people have asked how to donate. I never
thought about it, and never expected to get donations. I do this because I enjoy it. If you want to donate,
I won't deny you, but I will not be upset if you don't.

to donate, go here: http://www.realmsofwarcraft.com/donate.php or make a donation through paypal... realmsofwarcraft@gmail.com

Here is a list of the patches, and a detailed description of each. (Not finished, but working on it.)

* All-In-One-NPC.patch
  NPC that does a variety of things, from buffing to morphing.

* Beastmaster.patch
  NPC that offers the sale of hunter pets. My version has pets in DB, and you can turn on/off hunter only, and GM only. You can also decide how much gold or tokens per pet, instead of per pet type (normal or exotic) like all the other beastmaster patches do.
